                <p>Norman Virgil Osborn is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
                    Comics. The character, created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, first appeared in The
                    Amazing Spider-Man #14 (July 1964) as the first and best-known incarnation of the Green Goblin. He
                    has endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three
                    archenemies, alongside Doctor Octopus and Venom. </p>
                    <br><br>
                <p>Osborn is depicted as an amoral industrialist head of science conglomerate Oscorp and the father of
                    Harry Osborn, the best friend of Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker. Osborn, in part as a reaction
                    to the death of his wife, maintains a cold disposition and is obsessed with attaining as much power
                    as possible. As a result, he treats his son coldly and openly favors Peter for his intellect,
                    leading Harry to often try and compensate. In his origin, Norman was exposed to an experimental
                    formula which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect, but also drove him to insanity. As the
                    Goblin, he adopted a Halloween-themed appearance: dressing in a goblin costume, riding on a
                    bat-shaped "Goblin Glider", and using an arsenal of high-tech weapons, such as grenade-like "Pumpkin
                    Bombs", to terrorize New York City</p>

                <p>Osborn has been part of many of Spider-Man's defining stories, most notably "The Night Gwen Stacy
                    Died" and the "Clone Saga". While his primary foe is Spider-Man, Osborn has often come into conflict
                    with Iron Man, Captain America and other superheroes in the Marvel Universe. Although Osborn
                    sometimes works with other supervillains such as Doctor Doom and Loki and groups like the Sinister
                    Six and the Dark Avengers, these relationships often collapse due to his desire for unbridled power.
                    Osborn's largest overarching story came during the line-wide "Dark Reign" and Siege comic book
                    events, in which he served as the main antagonist; during this time, he became the original
                    iteration of Iron Patriot</p>
                    <br>
                <p>The character has been in various top villain lists as one of Spider-Man's greatest enemies and one
                    of the greatest comic book villains of all time. The character's popularity has seen him appear on a
                    variety of merchandise, inspire real-world structures (such as theme park attractions) and be
                    referenced in a number of media. He has been adapted to serve as Spider-Man's adversary in
                    live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. Willem Dafoe played the character in Sam Raimi's
                    Spider-Man film trilogy and reprised the role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No
                    Way Home (2021), while Chris Cooper played the character in the film The Amazing Spider-Man 2
                    (2014). </p>

                    During the "Clone Saga", a retcon was made, which determined that Norman Osborn survived the events
                    of The Amazing Spider-Man #122 and had been playing a behind-the-scenes role in Spider-Man's
                    adventures since then. During the "Clone Saga", the Spider-Man writers were met with a
                    massive outcry from many readers after the decision to replace Peter Parker with his clone Ben
                    Reilly as the true Spider-Man. Eventually, the writers decided to reveal that one of Spider-Man's
                    arch-enemies had been manipulating events from behind the scenes. The initial plan was to use
                    Mephisto, but they felt a more down-to-earth character was needed. It was then suggested that
                    the semi-zombified cyborg "Gaunt" be revealed as Harry Osborn (who was killed in The Spectacular
                    Spider-Man #200).
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gaunt was a late entry to the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return
                    Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for
                    tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone, and assuming his father's Green Goblin identity.
                    However, this narrative was rejected by newly promoted editor in chief Bob Harras,[18] and
                    eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following the Clone Saga, Green Goblin
                    re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man's nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of
                    several arcs thereafter.
                    <br>
                    Osborn returns in Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 and is blown up at the end of the issue.[20] It is
                    shown in The Spectacular Spider-Man #250 that he has recovered, and he returns to his civilian life.
                    Without the Green Goblin identity, Osborn would then go on to attack Spider-Man indirectly, through
                    minions and via smear campaigns designed to portray him as a monster. However, Norman would still
                    wear his Green Goblin costume when needed.
