            <h2># Syntax support</h2>
            <p>Tailwind CSS uses a lot of custom CSS at-rules like @tailwind, @apply, and @screen, and in many editors
                this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren’t recognized.
                If you’re using VS Code, our official Tailwind CSS IntelliSense plugin includes a dedicated Tailwind CSS
                language mode that has support for all of the custom at-rules and functions Tailwind uses.
                In some cases, you may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict
                about the syntax it expects in your CSS files.
            </p>
            <h2># Automatic class sorting with Prettier</h2>
            <p>It works seamlessly with custom Tailwind configurations, and because it’s just a Prettier plugin, it
                works anywhere Prettier works — including every popular editor and IDE, and of course on the command
                line.</p>

        <section id="PostCSS" class="main-section">
            <header>Using PostCSS as your preprocessor</header>
            <p>If you’re using Tailwind for a brand new project and don’t need to integrate it with any existing
                Sass/Less/Stylus stylesheets, you should highly consider relying on other PostCSS plugins to add the
                preprocessor features you use instead of using a separate preprocessor.For a fairly comprehensive list
                of available PostCSS plugins see the PostCSS GitHub repository, but here are a few important ones we use
                on our own projects and can recommend.</p>
            <h2># Build-time imports</h2>
            <p>One of the most useful features preprocessors offer is the ability to organize your CSS into multiple
                files and combine them at build time by processing @import statements in advance, instead of in the
                browser.

                The canonical plugin for handling this with PostCSS is postcss-import.

                To use it, install the plugin via npm:</p>
            <code>npm install -D postcss-import</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2># Nesting</h2>
            <p>To add support for nested declarations, we recommend our bundled tailwindcss/nesting plugin, which is a
                PostCSS plugin that wraps postcss-nested or postcss-nesting and acts as a compatibility layer to make
                sure your nesting plugin of choice properly understands Tailwind’s custom syntax like @apply and
                @screen.</p>
            <p>By default, it uses the postcss-nested plugin under the hood, which uses a Sass-like syntax and is the
                plugin that powers nesting support in the Tailwind CSS plugin API.

                If you’d rather use postcss-nesting (which is based on the work-in-progress CSS Nesting specification),
                first install the plugin:</p>
            <code>npm install -D postcss-nesting</code>
            <ul> Best practise
                <li>Use a regular media query and theme()</li>
                <li>Use the @screen directive at the top-level</li>
                <li>Use theme() instead of @apply</li>
                <li>Use @css to avoid processing as Stylus</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Optimizing" class="main-section">
            <header>Optimizing for Production</header>
            <p>Tailwind CSS is incredibly performance focused and aims to produce the smallest CSS file possible by only
                generating the CSS you are actually using in your project.

                Combined with minification and network compression, this usually leads to CSS files that are less than
                10kB, even for large projects. For example, Netflix uses Tailwind for Netflix Top 10 and the entire
                website delivers only 6.5kB of CSS over the network.

                With CSS files this small, you don’t have to worry about complex solutions like code-splitting your CSS
                for each page, and can instead just ship a single small CSS file that’s downloaded once and cached until
                you redeploy your site.

                For the smallest possible production build, we recommend minifying your CSS with a tool like cssnano,
                and compressing your CSS with Brotli.</p>
            <p>If you’re using Tailwind CLI, you can minify your CSS by adding the --minify flag:</p>
            <code>npx tailwindcss -o build.css --minify</code>
            <ul>Plugins
                <li>tailwindcss</li>
                <li>autoprefixers</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Browser" class="main-section">
            <header>Browser Support</header>
            <p>Understanding which browsers Tailwind supports and how to manage vendor prefixes.

                In general, Tailwind CSS v3.0 is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome,
                Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.

                While most of the features in Tailwind CSS will work in all modern browsers, Tailwind also includes APIs
                for several bleeding-edge features that aren’t yet supported by all browsers, for example the
                :focus-visible pseudo-class and backdrop-filter utilities.

                Since Tailwind is such a low-level framework, it’s easy to avoid these features if you can’t use them by
                simply not using the utility or modifier that’s not supported, much like how you just wouldn’t use those
                CSS features in your CSS. </p>
            <h2># Vendor Prefixes</h2>
            <p>Many CSS properties require vendor prefixes to be understood by browsers, for example background-clip:
                text needs the -webkit prefix to work in most browsers. If you’re using the Tailwind CLI tool, vendor
                prefixes like this will be added automatically.

                If not, we recommend that you use Autoprefixer, which is a PostCSS plugin that automatically adds any
                necessary vendor prefixes based on the browsers you tell it you need to support.

                To use it, install it via npm:</p>
            <code>npm install -D autoprefixer</code>
            <ul>.bg-clip-text
                <li> background-clip: text;</li>
                <li>-webkit-background-clip: text;</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Responsive Design</header>
            <p>Using responsive utility variants to build adaptive user interfaces.
                ​
                Overview

                Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a
                piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.</p>
            <p>This works for every utility class in the framework, which means you can change literally anything at a
                given breakpoint — even things like letter spacing or cursor styles.

                Here’s a simple example of a marketing page component that uses a stacked layout on small screens, and a
                side-by-side layout on larger screens (resize your browser to see it in action):</p>
            <h2># Working mobile-first</h2>
            <p>By default, Tailwind uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other
                frameworks like Bootstrap.

                What this means is that unprefixed utilities (like uppercase) take effect on all screen sizes, while
                prefixed utilities (like md:uppercase) only take effect at the specified breakpoint and above.</p>

            <h2># Targeting a breakpoint range</h2>
            <p>By default, styles applied by rules like md:flex will apply at that breakpoint and stay applied at larger
                breakpoints.

                If you’d like to apply a utility only when a specific breakpoint range is active, stack a responsive
                modifier like md with a max-* modifier to limit that style to a specific range:</p>
            <code>max-md	@media not all and (min-width: 768px) { ... }</code>
            <ul> Some more modifier and queries
                <li>max-md @media not all and (min-width: 768px) { ... }</li>
                <li>max-lg @media not all and (min-width: 1024px) { ... }</li>
                <li>max-xl @media not all and (min-width: 1280px) { ... }</li>
                <li>max-2xl @media not all and (min-width: 1536px) { ... }</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Dark" class="main-section">
            <header>Dark Mode</header>
            <p>Using Tailwind CSS to style your site in dark mode.
                ​
                Basic usage

                Now that dark mode is a first-class feature of many operating systems, it’s becoming more and more
                common to design a dark version of your website to go along with the default design.

                To make this as easy as possible, Tailwind includes a dark variant that lets you style your site
                differently when dark mode is enabled:</p>
            <h2># Toggling dark mode manually</h2>
            <p>If you’ve set a prefix in your Tailwind config, be sure to add that to the dark class. For example, if
                you have a prefix of tw-, you’ll need to use the tw-dark class to enable dark mode.

                How you add the dark class to the html element is up to you, but a common approach is to use a bit of JS
                that reads a preference from somewhere (like localStorage) and updates the DOM accordingly.</p>
            <h2># Customizing the class name</h2>
            <p>Some frameworks (like NativeScript) have their own approach to enabling dark mode and add a different
                class name when dark mode is active.

                You can customize the dark mode selector name by setting darkMode to an array with your custom selector
                as the second item:</p>
            <code>darkMode: ['class', '[data-mode="dark"]']</code>
            <ul> Types of theme:
                <li>localStorage.theme = 'light'</li>
                <li>localStorage.theme = 'dark'</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Reusing" class="main-section">
            <header>Reusing Styles</header>
            <p>Managing duplication and creating reusable abstractions.

                Tailwind encourages a utility-first workflow, where designs are implemented using only low-level utility
                classes. This is a powerful way to avoid premature abstraction and the pain points that come with it.

                But of course as a project grows, you’ll inevitably find yourself repeating common utility combinations
                to recreate the same design in many different places.

                For example, in the template below you can see the utility classes for each avatar image are repeated
                five separate times:</p>
            <h2># Using editor and language features</h2>
            <p>A lot of the time, duplication like this isn’t even a real problem because it’s all together in one
                place, or doesn’t even actually exist because you’re iterating over an array of items and only writing
                the markup once.

                If the styles you need to reuse only need to be reused within a single file, multi-cursor editing and
                loops are the simplest way to manage any duplication.</p>
            <h2># Loops</h2>
            <p>Before you assume you’re going to need to extract a component or create a custom class for something,
                make sure you’re actually using it more than once in your template.

                A lot of the time a design element that shows up more than once in the rendered page is only actually
                authored once because the actual markup is rendered in a loop.

                For example, the duplicate avatars at the beginning of this guide would almost certainly be rendered in
                a loop in a real project:</p>
            <code>{#each contributors as user}
                img class="inline-block h-12 w-12 rounded-full ring-2 ring-white"</code>
